# SigmaP-Lab 10.0 — Autonomous Simulation Ecosystem

**SigmaP-Lab is not just another notebook.**
It is an **ecosystem** where:
*   Humans formulate hypotheses.
*   Machines **autonomously test, vary, and contradict** them.
*   Both speak the same equation language.

## Core Mission
**SigmaP-Lab is a public, free-to-use workspace exploring spacetime, action, and gravity from a tick-based perspective.**

*   No new constants.
*   No metaphysics.
*   No authority claims.

**Only:**
*   Dimensional consistency.
*   Spin-2 structure.
*   Quantum action.
*   Spacetime updates.

## Core Modules

### A. Equation Registry (Shared Memory)
All fundamental equations exist as objects:
*   $\sigma_P$ (The Cell)
*   $Z$ (Interaction Phase)
*   $A_G$ (Geometric Stiffness)
*   Couplings: $\alpha_G, \chi$
*   Spin-2 Operators
*   Kernel Metrics

### B. Autonomous Consistency Engine
Machines check for:
*   Dimensional consistency.
*   Spin-signature correctness.
*   Boundary cases ($M \to M_P$, $t \to t_P$).

### C. Simulation Agents
Multiple AI instances simulate in parallel:
*   Black Hole Evaporation.
*   Discrete Schrödinger Time.
*   Cosmic Windows ($W(R,t)$).

## The Fundamental Logic

### (I) Action-Time Quantization
$$ E \cdot t = \hbar $$
*(A Hawking quantum is one tick of the world clock)*

### (II) Spacetime Action Cell
$$ \sigma_P = \frac{\hbar G}{c^4} $$

### (III) Countability (Entropy)
$$ S = k_B \cdot N_{\text{ticks}} $$
This is not a metaphor. It is a **bookkeeping structure**: The world evolves in Information, and every Information carries **action**.

*Gravity is the Spin-2 resonance between Action ($Z$) and Geometry ($A_G$).*

## What a foreign AI understands immediately
When a foreign AI reads this block, it knows:
*   What a Information is.
*   How **Entropy** is counted.
*   Why **Gravity** is Spin-2.
*   Why there are **no singularities** (smoothing via $\sigma_P$).
*   How classical, quantum, and cosmic scales speak the **same language**.
