      <h2>Pure Action Core</h2>
      <p>In the zero-mass limit, the core carries energy almost exclusively as angular momentum
        \(E_{\text{core}} \sim \hbar \omega_{\max}\). Spin generates a magnetic field and an
        action-based "attraction" ℏ.</p>

      <h2>Mass Loading & Braking</h2>
      <p>Growing surrounding masses act as a mechanical load. They couple to the spin
        and brake it in favor of classical gravity (G, M_ext, r_s).</p>

      <h2>Kinematic Transformer</h2>
      <p>The black hole core functions like a kinematic motor: pure action at first,
        later mass load, heat, and radiation – instead of a static "abyss."
        Analogy: Stator / field coil ↔ Pure Action Core. In an electric motor, the field (stator/excitation winding)
        generates a torque before any load is attached.
        The "Pure Action Core" is exactly such a source: pure action ∼ℏω, maximum spin, strong magnetic field, yet
        hardly any "load" from mass.
        Rotor with load ↔ Mass Burden / Braking.
        If you attach a load to the shaft of an electric motor, the speed decreases, current/power loss increases, and
        part of the "pure" field energy goes out into heat, friction, and work.
        Accreted mass at the event horizon takes on this role: it brakes the spin, coupling energy into classical
        gravity, heat, radiation, and eventually star formation.
        Without mass load, the core runs like an electric motor at idle: pure action (ħ), high spin. With growing mass
        load, it is braked and its energy ends up in gravity, heat, and radiation.

    <h2>The Page Curve – Why It Is Important</h2>

    <p>
      The <strong>Page curve</strong> describes how the amount of information (entropy) of a
      black hole develops over its lifetime. It was proposed by Don Page to test whether
      black holes are compatible with quantum mechanics.
    </p>

    <h3>What Does the Page Curve Say?</h3>
    <p>
      When a black hole radiates particles, the radiation seems to be purely random at first:
      the measured entropy outside rises. Later, however, as quantum mechanics demands, the
      radiation must contain more and more information about the interior, so that the entropy
      falls again after a maximum – the curve thus has a "bell shape" instead of just growing
      indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      This maximum is called the <em>Page time</em>. It marks the turning point: from here on,
      the black hole begins to give information net back to the universe, instead of
      apparently swallowing it.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Is This Important?</h3>
    <p>
      A curve that only rises and never falls would mean: information disappears permanently
      in a hole – this contradicts quantum mechanics. A Page curve with rise, maximum, and
      fall is the minimum criterion for a <strong>unitary</strong> (information-preserving)
      evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every serious solution to the information paradox must therefore deliver a Page-like
      entropy development: first more disorder and entanglement, later ordered return of the
      information to the environment.
    </p>

    <h3>How Does This Fit Our Spin Motor?</h3>
    <p>
      In this model, the core starts as an almost "load-free" spin motor after the supernova:
      pure action, high angular momentum, strong magnetic field. While more and more matter
      is collected and scattered out again, the entropy of the overall system grows –
      the Page curve rises.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the gravity of the outer mass shell brakes the inner quantum spin, a
      turning point is reached: the Page time. From here on, the motor converts its
      angular momentum energy more and more into radiation and new structure. The hidden
      entropy in the core decreases, while information becomes accessible again in the
      environment – the Page curve falls, without information really being lost.
