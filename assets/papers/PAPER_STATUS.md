# Paper Status And Claim Levels

Repository-level classification for `assets/papers/*.tex`.

Goal: lower rhetorical claim level, mark document type clearly, and separate working theory drafts from analogy/essay material without deleting ideas.

## Claim-Level Guidelines

- `Working reference`: notation/formula summaries and internal registries. Not a proof or empirical result by themselves.
- `Exploratory theory draft`: proposed equations/derivations/interpretations under active development; requires consistency checks and testing.
- `Phenomenology draft`: testable quantitative proposals, but not yet established without benchmark fits and uncertainty analysis.
- `Conceptual essay / position paper`: interpretive or argumentative synthesis; scientific claims need separate technical support.
- `Analogy note / concept sketch`: heuristic or intuition-building text; not a validated derivation.

## Paper Classification

| File | Document Type | Claim Level (summary) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A Requiem for LCDM.tex` | Conceptual Essay / Position Paper (working draft) | Interpretive and hypothesis driven. Scientific and cosmological claims require separate derivations, uncertainty estimates, and independent data-model comparison. |
| `Anthony_Thesis.tex` | Thesis Draft (cross-domain research) | Preliminary research claims. Methods, statistics, and conclusions require replication and external review before strong claims are made. |
| `die natürliche Struktur der Raumzeit.tex` | Working Paper (theory framework draft) | Exploratory theory draft. Equations and interpretations are proposed working hypotheses pending derivation checks, consistency checks, and empirical testing. |
| `Formelsammlung.tex` | Formula Collection (working reference) | Working notation and formula registry. Entries summarize definitions and relations, but they are not by themselves proofs or validated predictions. |
| `Formula_Collection_URM.tex` | Formula Collection (working reference) | Working notation and formula registry. Statements are concise summaries and may be revised as derivations are tightened. |
| `MOND_from_Smeared_GR.tex` | Working Paper (phenomenology derivation draft) | Testable theoretical hypothesis. Derivations and assumptions should be treated as draft-level until fully checked and compared against standard benchmarks and observational fits. |
| `QFT,GR und SRT.tex` | Working Paper (synthesis notes) | Exploratory synthesis draft. It combines theory ideas and interpretations that need systematic separation into formal derivations, assumptions, and empirical consequences. |
| `QSTF_Hierarchical_Mergers.tex` | Working Paper (phenomenology draft) | Exploratory phenomenology draft. Quantitative claims should be treated as provisional until benchmarked against GR waveforms and astrophysical population models. |
| `Quantum Gravity aus erster Geometrie.tex` | Working Paper (conceptual/theory draft) | Exploratory theory draft. Core claims are proposed interpretations requiring stronger derivation chains and external consistency checks. |
| `Rediscovering Geometry without SuperMUC.tex` | Working Paper (analytic counter-model draft) | Exploratory analytic comparison draft. Claims should be read as model proposals until assumptions and observational comparators are fully documented. |
| `Spin_Dynamics.tex` | Analogy Note (concept sketch) | Heuristic analogy and concept sketch, not a validated physical derivation or quantitative black-hole model. |
| `The Dimensional Structure of Reality.tex` | Working Paper (dimensional analysis draft) | Exploratory dimensional-analysis draft. Dimensional consistency does not by itself establish physical validity or empirical correctness. |
| `The Memory of Spacetime.tex` | Working Paper (conceptual/theory draft) | Exploratory theory draft. Interpretive conclusions and broad claims should be treated as provisional until supported by explicit derivations and comparison to established results. |
| `The Paradox Paper.tex` | Conceptual Essay / Working Paper (synthesis draft) | Interpretive synthesis draft. Proposed resolutions are hypotheses and conceptual arguments, not closed proofs or officially settled physics results. |
| `The Problem of Time.tex` | Working Paper (conceptual/theory draft) | Exploratory theory draft. Claims about foundational resolution should be read as hypotheses pending formal compatibility checks with GR/QFT and empirical consequences. |
| `Universal_Resonance_Model.tex` | Conceptual Essay / Analogy Framework | Conceptual and philosophical framework text. Physical claims are speculative unless separately derived and tested. |
| `Zander_2025_Dimensional_Foundations.tex` | Working Paper (dimensional foundations draft) | Exploratory dimensional and theoretical draft. Relations should be treated as provisional until mathematically and physically benchmarked. |
| `Zander_2025_Natural_Structure.tex` | Working Paper (theory framework draft) | Exploratory theory draft. Strong phenomenological claims require independent reproduction, parameter accounting, and full observational comparison. |
| `Zander_2025_Price_of_Love.tex` | Conceptual Essay / Analogy Note | Interpretive and analogical text. Scientific statements should be treated as heuristic unless independently derived and tested in a dedicated technical paper. |
| `Zander_2025_Time_Entropy.tex` | Working Paper (conceptual/theory draft) | Exploratory theory draft. Claims about emergence of time/entropy should be treated as hypotheses pending formal derivation and consistency checks. |

## Notes

- These labels are editorial repository metadata, not peer-review judgments.
- They are intended to calibrate claim language and improve future review discipline.
- Files can move between categories as derivations, checks, and benchmarks improve.
