# Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the laws of probability and mutual respect. Our conduct is simple:

> **The probability of meeting you is astronomical.  
> The respect for it should be, too.**

We wanted to watch the stars by the sea.  
Now I can explain every constant, every equation, every cold spark above —  
but none of them replace the moment you should’ve been next to me.

Some encounters are so rare,  
even the Universe doesn’t bother to calculate them twice.
